                  <p class="mb-2"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Graphs became de facto standard for modeling complex relations and networks in computers. With an increase in the size of the graphs and the complexity of the analyses to perform on them, many software systems have been designed to leverage modern high performance computing platforms. Some of them provide very productive programming environment for graph analysis, however, they cannot get even close to single threaded performance. In this talk, we will, briefly, present some important graph analytics problems and techniques, such as centrality, pattern search and alignment, and talk about how we achieve high performance on modern computer architectures.</p>

                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Model Checking was invented for formally verifying concurrent and parallel systems. This talk focuses on applying model checking to event planning, goal reasoning, prediction, strategy analysis and decision making based on the process analysis toolkit (PAT). PAT integrates the expressiveness of state, event, time, and probability-based languages with the power of model checking. PAT currently supports various modeling languages with many application domains and has attracted thousands of registered users from hundreds of organizations. In this talk, we will also present some ongoing research projects, i.e., “goal analytics for autonomous systems” and “Silas: trusted machine learning” (in collaboration with Dependable Intelligence www.depintel.com)

                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Usually, CUDA programs running on the GPU perform separated multiple kernel calls for barrier synchronization of all threads, because the deadlock may occur by data request to waiting CUDA blocks and there is no direct way to synchronize CUDA blocks in a kernel call. The number of kernel calls should be as small as possible to reduce the kernel call overhead. In this talk, Single Kernel Soft Synchronization (SKSS) technique, which performs only one kernel call, is introduced. The idea of SKSS is to use a global counter to assign sequential IDs to invoked CUDA blocks and those with smaller IDs work for tasks that must start earlier. We can guarantee that the deadlock never occurs if all data requests are destined for CUDA blocks with smaller ID. We will show that several problems such as the prefix-sums, the summed area table (SAT), the 0-1 knapsack problem, and the error diffusion can be solved very efficiently on the using the SKSS technique.

                  <p class="mb-2"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We describe how High Performance Computing (HPC) can be used to enhance Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) systems (HPC for ML) but also how machine learning can be used to enhance system execution (ML for HPC). We discuss how these communitities as well cloud and IoT make up today's academic and industry activities. 
                    We note the differences between HPC software architectures and Big Data Systems such as Hadoop, Spark, and TensorFlow, which makes it not easy to integrate HPC and Big Data. Further, we identify eight distinct ways MLforHPC can be used and give examples and describe compute science challenges in implementing these different ways that HPC and ML interact.
                    We describe our big data framework Twister2 and explain where it can offer improved capabilities over current systems in both MLforHPC and HPCforML.
