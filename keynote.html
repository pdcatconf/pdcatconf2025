              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>The rise of large foundation models and generative AI has introduced unprecedented demands in computing power, particularly for model pre-training and real-time inference. Cloud infrastructure and cloud-edge services play a pivotal role in supporting machine learning development, enabling an optimal balance between training efficiency and inference performance.  In this talk, we will explore key challenges in resource management and model compression for cloud-native data centers tailored to large-scale AI models. We will present recent research advances that enhance the efficiency of large model deployment and discuss their implications for real-world AI applications. Finally, we will also share insights on the future evolution of large model operating systems and their role in advancing AI infrastructure.

              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>Advances in digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming industries, reshaping communities, and redefining how we solve complex problems. Among the diverse methodologies of AI, Computational Intelligence (CI), including neural, fuzzy, and evolutionary computing, offers useful models for tackling the dynamic and uncertain nature of real-world environments. This presentation will explore recent advances in CI models for data analytics, focusing on challenges such as achieving incremental learning in rapidly changing environments without catastrophic forgetting, and enhancing the interpretability of model predictions. Practical applications across manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare will be highlighted to illustrate how CI models move from theory into impactful deployment. The presentation will also discuss the broader implications of CI in driving innovation for Industry 4.0 and setting the stage for Industry 5.0 and beyond.
